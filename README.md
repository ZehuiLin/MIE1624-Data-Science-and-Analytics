In this repository, you will find two assignments that I did for a data science master's course at the University of Toronto. 

In the first assignment, I collected and cleaned the 2019 Kaggle ML & DS Survey data, explored the dataset, applied feature engineering and selected features for the purpose of salary bucket classification, implemented logistic regression algorithm for calssifying a survey participant's salary bucket, and finally, fine tuned the logistic regression model. 

In the second assignment, I collected and cleaned tweets on the 2019 Canadian Election, explored the dataset, and implemented Natural Language Processing for the purpose of sentiment analysis. Machine learning models developed for sentiment analysis included logistic regression, k-NN, Naive Bayes, SVM, decision trees, and Random Forest. The ultimate question that the entire analysis was trying to answer was: "What can public opinion on Twitter tell us about the Canadian political landscape in 2019?"
